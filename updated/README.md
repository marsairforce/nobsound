# Nobsound EL84 Amplifier

This is the updated schematic of the (formerly 6P1) amplifier.

These are likely to change as I continue to hack it up and "improve" it.

## First Wave Enhancemnts

The objective here:

* To replace the 6H8C preamp tube per channel with a 12AX7 tube per channel.
* To replace the pair of 6P1 tubes per channel with a single EL84 tube per channel.
* The rectifier with regular diodes.

By 2020-07-29 I was able meet my original objectives. And to do so without purchasing any electronic components or tubes. Which for me and my projects is highly unusual. And now I have a special sense of smug-ness as well.

I orginally went with a 12AT7 tubes. As they have less gain then the 12AX7 tubes. But I found the sound to be crackly and brittle. I tried to replace the coupling capacitor (which is likely a 0.022uF capacitor) with a 0.1uF capacitor. This gives it a bit more bass response. But still not very good. I guess there is that problem were the 12AT7 is generally considered to be not musical at all. I ended up putting some old Mullard 12AX7 tubes I had in my junk drawer. They have "Holland" printed on them. And even do a really nice vintage filament flash when turning on. But they are really crisp and awesome sounding. Using old tubes (likely liberated from my Traynor amp) onto here is like a fine bottle of wine with peanut butter toast. But you only live once, so might as well enjoy the stuff I have rather than hoarding it forever and not using it.
